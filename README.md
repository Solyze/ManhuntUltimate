# ManhuntUltimate
A Manhunt plugin with extra features Inspired by Dream Teams Minecraft Speedrunner VS Hunter aka. Manhunt. The speedrunner(s) attempt to beat the game (Minecraft) by killing the ender dragon, whilst the hunter(s) try to stop them from doing so. You make your own rules, this is not designed to be used on server networks or work with other plugins, rather to be played with your friends.
